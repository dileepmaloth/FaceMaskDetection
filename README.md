Install all the dependencies that are present in dependencies txt file.
Run the train algo py file to train the algorithm using the data set.
run the camera usage py file to check the detection.

*********************************************************************************************************************
** • Developed a model for detecting the facemask's presence on a person's face, with a 99% validation accuracy    **
** • Used mobilenetv2, a convolutional neural network architecture, as the initial model for feature extraction    **
** • Used weights pre-trained on the ImageNet database and froze the layers of the initial model from training     **
** • Connected the initial model to a fully connected neural network built using the Sequential model from Keras   **
** • Used Data Augmentation and Early Stopping to prevent overfitting and improve the model's validation accuracy  **
